# Sundial for CTF4Science

This directory contains the evaluation code for the Sundial foundation model within the CTF4Science framework.

## Introduction

Sundial is a family of **generative** time series foundation models, which is pre-trained on TimeBench (**10^12** time points). The model can be applied for both **point** / **probabilistic** **zero-shot** forecasting.

Not only the mean or quantiles, you can estimate anything about the predictive distribution with raw generated samples.

We propose **TimeFlow Loss** to predict next-patchâ€™s distribution, allowing Transformers to be trained **without discrete tokenization** and make **non-deterministic predictions**.
